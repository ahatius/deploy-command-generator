# General
Generates a list of mvn commands that can be executed to upload artifacts from a directory to a
remote repository. To use the generated commands, you need to configure your Maven settings.xml with
the target repository (id, user, password).

# Configuration
Example repository configuration:
```xml
<settings>
    ...
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>repository-id</id>
            <username>deployment-user</username>
            <password>password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>

```

The value of the `<id>` tag needs to be passed as the `-r` parameter to the application.

# Usage
```
The following options are required: -o -r -d -u

Usage: <main class> [options]
  Options:
  * -d
       The directory to scan for pom files
  * -o
       The shell script that should be generated by this application
  * -r
       The target repository id that is configured in the settings.xml
  * -u
       The target deployment URL of the repository

```
